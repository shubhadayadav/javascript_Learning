    <!-- why is to place scripts just before the closing  tag ans: Scripts often interact with or manipulate HTML elements on the page. By placing the scripts at the end of the <body>, it ensures that all HTML elements have been parsed and are available in the DOM when the script attempts to access or modify them. If scripts are placed in the <head> or early in the <body>, they might try to interact with elements that haven't been loaded yet, leading to errors.  -->
